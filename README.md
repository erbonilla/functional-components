# ⚛️ Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

---

## 📜 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### 🟢 `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

---

### 🧪 `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more info.

---

### 🏗️ `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for performance.  
The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!  

More details: [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)

### ⚠️ `npm run eject`

> **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you're not happy with the build tools or configs, `eject` gives you full control.  
It will copy all configs and dependencies like Webpack, Babel, ESLint into your project.  

You can still run all commands, but now you manage the scripts.  
You don’t have to use `eject` — the built-in features work great for most apps!
